# Smart Media

Come create tailored media and news experiences based on a reader’s context in the physical world. Imagine a bathroom mirror that displays the day’s top news headlines, or a mobile app that detects when you’re walking and starts playing your queued audio stories.

We now have the technical means to gather a bunch of data about how people are using their various devices, and we should be doing more to leverage this data to inform how we serve content.

The bottom line is this: we have to listen to our users. But, users don't necessarily know what they want. Using a phone's gyroscope and accelerometer, we can gather realtime data about how people are using their device at a given point in time – we know if they are walking, lying down, we can get the weather, and decide when to hit users. This allows news organizations to craft content towards users, for example, we know when you're distracted, so we can give you bulleted points of an article.
 
#### What will your session allow people to make, learn or do?
This design challenge focuses on crafting experiences for smart media – how to meet users where they are and tailor content and medium in which it's delivered, informed by their situation. Services like Google and Twitter are already tailoring our searches based on location – but we are going to take this idea a step further and apply it to media.

You'll learn how to leverage user data (how people are using their devices), other data (like weather) to help make decisions about what content to present.

#### How do you see that working?
We'll spend the first few minutes sharing how we consume media at various points in the day, to get the ideas flowing. Participants will then be broken into small teams to come up with a solution for a context-driven smart media idea. Each team will go through the design process – identifying users, scope, delineating user needs, coming up with a problem statement. Every team will prototype / wireframe their idea and we'll present and critique at the end.

#### How will you deal with 5, 15, 50 participants?
Since this is a group-based lab, only the size of the groups will vary with number of participants. We'll keep the groups small, but if the session is on the full side, we'll limit the presentations to short elevator pitches.

#### How long within your session before someone else can teach this?
Within the first few minutes of small group time – after the process for a design thinking exercise has been laid out, this can be applied to other questions people want to tackle/teach.

#### What outcomes would you like to see after the session?
Taking these smart/context-based media ideas from wireframes and turning them into reality. A lot of this can already be done with existing technology – leveraging the gyroscope and accelerometers on mobile devices to help inform the decision about what medium to present content through (i.e. if walking, play audio; if lying down, start video).

#### What organisations or companies might be interested to participate in this session?
Anyone who's interested in storytelling and gets geeked about future media ideas.

#### Is this session appropriate and interesting for a younger audience (under 18)?
Yes

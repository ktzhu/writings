# Re-thinking J-school
----------------------

"Wow, you're doing journalism and computer science? Our school doesn't have a joint program like that!"

Well, neither does my school.

The field of journalism has always been interdisciplinary, though traditionally this has been with non-technical disciplines.

But times have changed, and the fields of mathematics, statistics and computer science are ever more important to the emerging fields of data journalism, information graphics, and news applications.

So it's time we took a long hard look at the way we're teaching journalism â€“ are we really being prepared in the best way possible for the journalism industry?

News organizations are not hiring as many editors or reporters. In fact, some places are doing the opposite of hiring them.

Having technical skills makes you marketable, but I'm not in it for the money or the jobs. I'm in it because I truly believe knowing how to express myself in code makes me better equipped to tell stories in new and exciting ways. It makes me better positioned to imagine novel approaches to the way people produce and consume information.

But let's go back to school.

Because I can honestly count on one hand (okay, a finger) the number of journalism professors who _get it._ Who have taught me valuable skills I've applied in my internships on news applications teams, who teach from an approach of storytelling on the web, who have exposed me to the overlap of journalism and fields of statistics, computer science and other technical disciplines.

One professor.

I've learned a lot from my peers. From extracurriculars. From internships. From my own side projects.

But a lot of people I talk to have this false conception of how integrated my journalism program is with the technical side of things and that's simply not the case. There are a few exceptions, to be sure, but on the whole, my journalism program does not foster a true, technically integrated education. In fact, it's pretty much near impossible to double major in our engineering school and journalism school if you don't want to shell out another year's worth of tuition. And for those who do, it's nothing short of killing yourself and taking 5, 6 credits a quarter to be able to get it done and graduate on time.

Why is this the case? Why is there not more room in the curriculum for computer science or statistics specialities? Maybe allowing students to choose between either a humanities or social science concentration or an engineering one?

While I agree the classes within the journalism school also need to catch up to this Internet age, I think the bigger issue is leveraging the existing resources (outside of the j-school) at universities to supplement journalism curriculums.
